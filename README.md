## Customer Segmentation and Statistical Analysis

Segmenting Customers to Boost Sales and Loyalty

### Introduction

Discover how to segment your customers effectively to improve marketing strategies and enhance customer loyalty. This project analyzes customer data to identify key segments, helping businesses tailor their approaches for better engagement and increased sales.

### Project Overview

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
* Remove duplicates and handle missing values.
* Format the data correctly for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Visualize relationships between demographic factors and spending.
*	Understand the distribution of key variables.
3. Customer Segmentation:
*	Perform clustering to identify distinct customer groups.
*	Use label encoding, standard scaling, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for better clustering and visualization.
4. Statistical Analysis:
*	Check relationships between variables using correlation and chi-square tests.
*	Validate significant associations and patterns.
5. Insights and Recommendations:
*	Provide actionable insights for targeted marketing.
*	Recommend strategies to attract and retain customers.

### User Instruction

### Instructions

1. Data Preparation:
*	Ensure data is cleaned and preprocessed.
*	Use `LabelEncoder` for categorical variables and `StandardScaler` for normalization.
2. Clustering:
*	Apply k-means clustering and PCA for dimensionality reduction.
*	Visualize clusters to understand customer segments.
3. Statistical Testing:
*	Perform correlation analysis and chi-square tests to validate findings.
*	Ensure assumptions for statistical tests are checked.
4. Insight Generation:
*	Interpret results and provide practical recommendations.
*	Tailor insights for targeted marketing strategies.

If you find a bug or have an idea for an improvement:
1. Open an issue on GitHub detailing the problem or suggestion.
2. Fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
3. Follow the project's coding standards and provide clear documentation.

### Things That Don't Work

*	Certain clusters may not be well-defined due to overlapping spending habits.
*	The current model does not account for seasonal changes in spending behavior.

### Things That Work

*	Age group and spending levels are strongly correlated.
*	Effective customer segments have been identified for targeted marketing.
